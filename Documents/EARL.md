# Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locators

Encrypted Authenticated Resource Locators (EARL)s are a technology proposed in
the Mathematical Mesh.

An EARL is a compact bearer token which allows the person reading it to locate,
authenticate and decrypt a remote document.

The main use case for EARLs is in business processes which involve a mixture of 
paper and electronic flows. It is easy to print a document and turn it 
into a paper document but converting paper documents to machine readable form
requires effort. There is thus a natural tendency for hybrid electronic/paper
flows to degenerate to paper flow as the lowest common denominator.

PHB should be extended to support resolution of EARLs to decrypt and authenticate
the resulting digital document.
