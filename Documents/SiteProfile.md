# Site specific profile

There are some occasions on which I would like to be able to change the configuration of
the browser according to the site I am visiting:

* Enable audio output (Disabled by default)

* Fake User-Agent field

* Use specific network security settings

##  Enable audio output

Audio output is disruptive to both the user and those around them. Like any other potentially
disruptive feature, audio output should be off by default with the ability to enable them
for specific sites such as YouTube where the whole point is the audio experience.

Every time I visit CNN, a cheery voice tells me that 'Everyone has a Safelite story'. Why
yes I do and it is not a good one. I took my car in to have the windshield fixed to be
told that they needed to order a part. This was the first failure, they knew that the 
part is necessary to replace the windshield on an XK8 so they should have ordered the clips 
at the same time as the windscreen. They said they would call back when the part arrived.
Two weeks later, they had not.

Long story short, the Safelite people lied to me repeatedly. The parts had not come in 
because they had never been ordered. The situation was only fixed when I called my insurer
and told them to fix safelite for me. 


##  Fake User-Agent field

No Google, I do not wish to switch to Chrome. No Microsoft, I do not wish to switch to Edge.
I have both of them loaded on my machine and I am using this particular browser because it
is the one I chose to use. How dare you keep nagging me to switch? Are your managers stupid
or just incredibly greedy and rude?

The need to give a false User-Agent has been understoood since the Netscape/Microsoft 
browser wars of the mid 1990s. Sites would only display rich content in the latest edition 
of HTML if the user agfent field claimed to be Netscape Navigator and for all I know, 
this is probably still the case today.

The only way to end the browser-bullying is for the user to take control with a browser that
tells the bully what they want to hear. The user visits Microsoft and the browser says it
is Edge (which in the case of PHB is true). The user visits a Google site and the browser
says it is Chrome.


## Use specific network security settings

There are some sites for which I would like to be able to override the browser settings
on a case by case basis. This might be to increase the security level of the site by 
tunnelling the connection through TOR or a VPN or to allow the use of a self signed 
certificate.
