# Basic Browser Features

Quite a bit of what is needed to convert PHB into a full featured browser is code that
just re-enables features lost from Edge. In most instances, these capabilities are
fairly straightforward.

Hints on how to implement these features appear in the [Implementation document](Implementation.md)


## Icons and basic chrome

At present the buttons have text rather than icons. These must be in the Edge toolset 
somewhere, just need to find them and re-enable.

## Internationalization

Multi-lingual support for browser pages etc.
