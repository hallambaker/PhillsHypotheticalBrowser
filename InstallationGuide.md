# Installation Guide

Supported Platforms

* [Windows 7, Windows 8, Windows 10, Window 11](#windows)

The WebView2 team is currently working on a MacOS release. While there is no mention of 
a Linux ore Android release, this seems likely since there are Linux and Android versions
of Edge. iOS might well require a completely different approach.

## Windows

There is currently no executable distribution or installer for PHB. This is planned.
